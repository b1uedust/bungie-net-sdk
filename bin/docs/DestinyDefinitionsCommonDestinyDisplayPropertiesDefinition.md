Name | Type | Description | Notes

**description** | **String** |  |  [optional]
**name** | **String** |  |  [optional]
**icon** | **String** | Note that \&quot;icon\&quot; is sometimes misleading, and should be interpreted in the context of the entity. For instance, in Destiny 1 the DestinyRecordBookDefinition&#39;s icon was a big picture of a book.  But usually, it will be a small square image that you can use as... well, an icon. |  [optional]
